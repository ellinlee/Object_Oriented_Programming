# Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Examples

This repository contains Java code that I wrote while studying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It includes various examples to understand basic OOP concepts.

### 1. Introduction to OOP
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which contain data and methods. OOP allows for more modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

### 2. Key Concepts Demonstrated
The examples in this repository cover the following OOP concepts:
- **Classes and Objects:** Creating and using objects from user-defined classes.
- **Inheritance:** Extending classes to inherit properties and methods.
- **Polymorphism:** Overloading and overriding methods to achieve flexible behavior.
- **Encapsulation:** Protecting data by using access modifiers.
- **Abstraction:** Using abstract classes and interfaces.

### 3. Code Examples
The following examples are included in the repository:
- **Basic Class and Object:** Demonstrates creating objects and invoking methods.
- **Inheritance Example:** Shows how derived classes inherit properties from base classes.
- **Polymorphism Example:** Illustrates method overloading and overriding.
- **Encapsulation Example:** Demonstrates data protection using getters and setters.
- **Abstraction Example:** Uses abstract classes and interfaces.

### 4. How to Run
To run the Java programs:
1. Compile the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac FileName.java
   ```
2. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   java FileName
   ```

Feel free to explore the code and enhance your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts!
